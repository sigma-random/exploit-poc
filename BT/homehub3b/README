DESCRIPTION
This proof-of-concept exploit code will yield a root shell on the
target HomeHub 3.0b. See included vulnerability report for details
and affected firmware versions.

This is NOT an unlock for your HomeHub 3.0b.  Although it will yield a
root shell, it does not, in itself, unlock your device.  It probably is only
useful to and should be used by those interested in conducting further 
research into the HomeHub 3.0b.

NOTES
--You must edit environment.py to set *your* ip address.  This is
   the address that the exploited router will call back to.
--This exploit is not whitespace-safe.  What this means for you is
   that your IP address must not contain any numbers which map to
   whitespace characters (space, tab, carriage return, etc). It must
   also not contain any 0 octets (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
--This is a multicast exploit.  Any device on the same LAN as the target
  device will receive the exploit packet.  Generally, this should not be a 
  problem, but you may care to use this only on an isolated network.  If any
  *other* devices misbehave when using this exploit, I would be interested in
  knowing.  email me at uid000_at_gmail_com.
