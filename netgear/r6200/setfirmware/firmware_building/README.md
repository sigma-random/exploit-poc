##Firmware Building

The python modules and scripts in this directory are involved in building firmware images for the Netgear R6200.

* ``checksums``: contains classes for producing the checksum values in the various headers.
* ``firmware_headers``: contains classes for generating various headers for R6200 firmware images.
* ``buildfw.py``: This script builds a valid firmware image out of one or more firmware components. Generally these components should be an LZMA-compressed kernel extracted from a firmware image, and a SquashFS filesystem image. The resulting firmware image can be parsed and flashed by the R6200's web server.
* ``build_janky_fw.py``: This script builds a firmware image with an ambit header customized for the broken firmware validation logic in the R6200's UPnP daemon. Like ``buildfw.py``, this script expects one or more firmware components, usually a kernel and filesystem. The resulting image can be parsed by ``upnpd`` if it's 4MB or less, but cannot be parsed by the web server.
