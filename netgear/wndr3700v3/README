This is proof-of-concept exploit code for the Netgear WNDR 3700v3 DLNA exploits
I briefed at Black Hat USA 2012 and DEF CON 20 in Las Vegas, NV in July 2012.
The exploit code works (for me) against firmware version 1.0.0.18 and MiniDLNA
version 1.0.18 (versions between the two, although similar, are unrelated).  It
may work for you, it may not.  Don't use it to attack routers you don't own.
If you do and get caught don't blame me or my employer.

Although complete exploit code was published on the Black Hat and DEF CON
conference CDs and websites, this is more up-to-date than what was distributed
and may be useful to some.

My whitepaper and Black Hat slides are included as well.
